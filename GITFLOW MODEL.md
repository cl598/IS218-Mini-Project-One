# GITFLOW

Branching method used for collaboration and teams to help maintain the code development, created by Vincent Driessen.

There are five branches...
* Feature
* Develop
* Release
* Hotfix
* Master

# GITFLOW BRANCHING MODEL

Every new development starts in the *feature* branch, where the developers begin building the code.

![Step One](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/GitFlowFeatureBranches.png)

*Feature* branch is branched off of the *develop* branch to merge the completed coding components back to the *develop* branch for the release.

![Step Two](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/GitFlowDevelopBranch.png)

Once the code is ready for release, the *release* branch is created off of the *develop* branch.
