Commit
Commiting code allows for changes to be made on the local system. This will have no affect on the remote until it is pushed to it.

Merge
Combines multiple groups of commits into one history, the primary use of this is to combine 2 or more branches into the master.

Checkout
Allows for target entities to be switched i.e files, commits, and branches

Push
Uploads the local repository to the remote and automatically attempts to apply the changes made.

Pull
Direct opposite of pushing, takes the remote repository and updates the local.
