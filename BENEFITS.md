# HOW DOES THESE FEATURES / METHODS IMPROVE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF A COMPANY?

**Git** is a 'free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.'

> Not only is it free, but its version control systems has quality performance for development teams from small to large sizes. It is open source, which means developers are able to contribute anywhere.

**Docker** is an 'open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications' in containers.

> The platform is fast and responsive in deployment.

**Automated testing** is a method to test and compare the expectation versus the reality of the outcome.

> Using the *automated testing* method will become faster for development, with more reliable outcomes. It has better accuracy compared to the manual testing method run by humans.

**Continuous integeration** is when developers update the code changes to the main project frequently.

> Applying the *Continuous integeration* method to every developer's work habit will allow the workflow to become much easier because they will be able to avoid revising outdated code-- saving time to apply for other coding components that may need more attention, and for a faster release.
